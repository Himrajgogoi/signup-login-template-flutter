# signup_login_template_v1

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Template for combining signup/login facility to your flutter application. Token-based Authentication has been used for enabling the authentication.
I made this template with reference from https://ohuru.tech/blog/2020/4/19/flutter-signuplogin-application-with-django-backend-3/. Modified to include  SignUp as well.
